# Project-3013FINAL
This project lets you see what active construction projects in New York City were cited by the Department of Buildings (DOB) for safely and code violations. The data is taken from January 2019 to December 2020. User can classify by borough, or by company name, which will give them lists of projects with violations. This project also allows you to see the change in the number of violations and construction permits issued due to the ongoing pandemic via a plot. Plots are in the output folder.
